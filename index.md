## - Prompt: Best Computing Experiences

### In Class

My computing experiences in class have been boring at best, though engaging and challenging in unique ways.  School has taught me nuances and key techniques that I would have never figured out on my own, but in a way that is spoon fed and sleep inducing.  Courses such as Data Structures and Software Engineering have been my best experiences due to the valuable knowledge they taught me.

### Out of Class

My best computing experiences have generally occurred outside of the academic setting.  The private sector offers a lot more wiggle room in terms of creative endavours such as IoT projects, cryptocurrencies, and beyond.  Strictly speaking on computing experiences, private sector has much more emphasis on 'doing', versus 'doing the right way'.  It is easy to get caught up in bad habits without ever learning the right habits.
